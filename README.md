# Blackjack in Javascript

Built from scratch in Javacsript with barebones code from Scrimba tutorial made by Per Harald Borgen. 

Background image was not made by me. 

### Current functionality past Per's course:
- keeps track of cards as if playing with 1 full deck each game.
- cards look like actual cards

### known bugs:
- clicking too fast on new card can occasionally cause extra hits when already >= 21

### upcoming functionality
- support ante and "winning"/"losing" credits
- play against "dealer"
