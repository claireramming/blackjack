# Blackjack in Javascript

Built from scratch in Javacsript with barebones code from Scrimba tutorial made by Per Harald Borgen. 

Background image was not made by me. 

### Current functionality past Per's course:
- keeps track of cards as if playing with full deck each game.
- cards look like actual cards
- support ante and "winning"/"losing" credits
- added Dealer functionality
- - hides dealer's initial second card until you are done
- - draw cards until you'd like to hold
- - shows the second card once holding
- - dealer logic forces dealer to draw until over 17
- - checks for natural blackjacks

### known bugs:
- FIXED: occasionally drawing two cards on one click

### upcoming functionality
- allow soft hands (currently all aces are 11 unless the drawn ace would force a bust)
- allow splitting of aces
